# Dark Mode Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Problem
Dark mode was working correctly in local development but not functioning after deploying to Vercel. The website would always load in light mode, and switching to dark mode had no effect.

## Root Cause
1. **Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC)**: The theme was only applied in a React `useEffect` hook, which runs after the initial render. This meant the page would briefly flash with the default theme before the correct theme was applied.
2. **localStorage Access**: The theme initialization from localStorage was happening asynchronously in React's effect lifecycle, causing a delay in theme application.
3. **Missing Vercel Configuration**: The project lacked proper Vercel configuration for SPA routing.

## Solution

### 1. Inline Script in HTML (Critical Fix)
Added an immediate script in `index.html` that runs before React hydrates:

```html
<script>
  // Immediately apply theme before React hydrates to prevent FOUC
  (function() {
    try {
      const theme = localStorage.getItem('theme') || 'light';
      const root = document.documentElement;
      root.classList.remove('light', 'dark');
      root.classList.add(theme);
    } catch (e) {
      // Fallback if localStorage is unavailable
      const root = document.documentElement;
      root.classList.remove('light', 'dark');
      root.classList.add('light');
    }
  })();
</script>
```

This script:
- Runs synchronously before any React code
- Applies the theme class immediately to the `<html>` element
- Prevents FOUC
- Handles localStorage errors gracefully

### 2. Enhanced React Component Safety
Updated `MainLayout.tsx` to:
- Add try-catch blocks around localStorage access
- Validate theme values ('light' or 'dark')
- Handle localStorage unavailability gracefully
- Prevent console errors on Vercel

### 3. Vercel Configuration
Created `vercel.json` with:
- SPA routing configuration (all routes redirect to index.html)
- Proper cache headers for static assets
- Security headers

## Files Modified

1. **mvp/index.html** - Added theme initialization script
2. **mvp/src/shared/components/layout/MainLayout/MainLayout.tsx** - Added error handling for localStorage
3. **mvp/vercel.json** - Created Vercel configuration (new file)

## Testing

After deployment, verify:
1. The page loads with the correct theme (no flashing)
2. Switching themes works correctly
3. Theme preference persists across page refreshes
4. Theme preference persists across different sessions
5. Works on both light and dark mode

## Technical Details

### Why the inline script works
- Runs before React hydration
- Synchronous execution prevents any delay
- Applies theme class to document root immediately
- Prevents any visual flash

### Why React useEffect wasn't enough
- useEffect runs after initial render
- Causes FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)
- Theme change visible to user
- Looks broken on first load

### Browser Compatibility
- Works in all modern browsers
- Gracefully handles localStorage restrictions
- Falls back to light theme if localStorage is unavailable
- Safe for environments with strict security policies

## Deployment Instructions

1. Push changes to your repository
2. Vercel will automatically detect the new `vercel.json`
3. Deployment will use the new configuration
4. Dark mode should now work correctly

## Additional Notes

- The theme is stored in `localStorage` with key `'theme'`
- Valid values are `'light'` and `'dark'`
- Default fallback is `'light'`
- All theme changes are persisted immediately
