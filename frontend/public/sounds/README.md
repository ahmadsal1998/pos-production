# Sounds Directory

This directory contains audio files used by the POS system.

## Required Files

- `beep.mp3` - A short beep sound that plays when a barcode is scanned or entered

## Adding the Beep Sound

You can add your own `beep.mp3` file here. The sound should be:
- Short (100-200ms recommended)
- Clear and audible
- Not too loud or jarring
- In MP3 format

If the file is not found, the system will automatically use a programmatically generated beep sound as a fallback.
